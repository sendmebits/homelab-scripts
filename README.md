# homelab-scripts
Welcome to my [homelab-scripts](https://github.com/sendmebits/homelab-scripts/) repository! This is a collection of scripts I’ve put together to streamline various tasks in my homelab. While their primary purpose is to help me with automation, backup and version control, I figured they might be useful to others too, so feel free to explore and adapt them.

## Categories

### 🛠️ General Scripts
These scripts are versatile and can be used on any Linux system, including Proxmox hosts. Useful for a variety of common tasks.

### 📦 LXC Scripts
Scripts specifically designed for use within Proxmox LXC containers. Configuring, managing, and automating tasks inside containers.

### 🖥️ Proxmox Scripts
These scripts are tailored for Proxmox VE hosts. While some may work in other environments with minor tweaks, they’re primarily focused on Proxmox-specific use cases.

Feel free to fork, tweak, and break things—just don’t @ me when you accidentally nuke your homelab. Kidding (mostly). If you have improvements or ideas, open a PR or drop an issue. Sharing ideas is always welcome, many of these scripts were created to solve a problem quickly and I'm sure there are more creative solutions.

Happy scripting! 🚀
