# homelab-scripts
This repository houses a collection of scripts that I use for various tasks within my homelab. Primarily created to ensure I have backups version control. Iâ€™ve made these available here in case others might find them useful as well.

## Proxmox
These scripts are meant to run on a Proxmov VE host, some would be useful in other scenarios, but would require some minor modifications.

## LXC
These scripts are meant to run inside Proxmox LXC containers.
